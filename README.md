# A-Fiery-WORKING-Title
[For all my push and pull needs whilst making this game for the SOFT166 module, and perhaps further beyond]

Welcome to the repository for AFWT! This has been the main thing that has kept track of my progress throughout its journey from idea to game. I intend to work on this over time, so be sure to stay tuned for that.

Some things to mention here:
All of the sprites used are my own work, hand-drawn to digitally uploaded using ArtWeaver.
The inspiration behind these characters come from me always drawing them back when I was younger, and I always wanted to get them in a game when I was older!

All of the music and sfx were also made by me using FLStudio Ver.7 and Ver.9
All of the code, though given guidance through the module, was programmed by me.

Many thanks to everyone that play-tested my game, and many thanks to all of you that may come across it and play it yourself!
This game was possible to make thanks to Unity.

Any glitches or bugs? Let me know through my itch.io page:
